NAME="DDL-ROWSECURITY"
>5.7. Row Security Policies</A
></H1
><P
>   In addition to the <A
HREF="ddl-priv.html"
>Section 5.6</A
> system available through
   <A
HREF="sql-grant.html"
>GRANT</A
>, tables can have row security policies
   which limit the rows returned for normal queries and rows which can
   be added through data modification commands.  By default, tables do
   not have any policies and all rows are visible and able to be added,
   subject to the regular <A
HREF="ddl-priv.html"
>Section 5.6</A
> system.  This is
   also known as Row Level Security.
  </P
><P
>   When row security is enabled on a table with
   <A
HREF="sql-altertable.html"
>ALTER TABLE</A
>, all normal access to the table
   (excluding the owner) for selecting rows or adding rows must be through
   a policy.  If no policy exists for the table, a default-deny policy is
   used and no rows are visible or can be added.  Privileges which operate
   at the whole table level such as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>TRUNCATE</TT
>, and
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>REFERENCES</TT
> are not subject to row security.
  </P
><P
>   Row security policies can be specific to commands, or to roles, or to
   both.  The commands available are <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ALL</TT
>,
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSERT</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UPDATE</TT
>, and
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>DELETE</TT
>.  Multiple roles can be assigned to a given policy
   and normal role membership and inheritance rules apply.
  </P
><P
>   To specify which rows are visible and what rows can be added to the
   table with row level security, an expression is required which returns
   a boolean result.  This expression will be evaluated for each row prior
   to other conditionals or functions which are part of the query.  The
   one exception to this rule are <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>leakproof</TT
> functions,
   which are guaranteed to not leak information.  Two expressions may be
   specified to provide independent control over the rows which are
   visible and the rows which are allowed to be added.  The expression
   is run as part of the query and with the privileges of the user
   running the query, however, security definer functions can be used in
   the expression.
  </P
><P
>   Enabling and disabling row security, as well as adding policies to a
   table, is always the privilege of the owner only.
  </P
><P
>   Policies are created using the <A
HREF="sql-createpolicy.html"
>CREATE POLICY</A
>
   command, altered using the <A
HREF="sql-alterpolicy.html"
>ALTER POLICY</A
> command,
   and dropped using the <A
HREF="sql-droppolicy.html"
>DROP POLICY</A
> command.  To
   enable and disable row security for a given table, use the
   <A
HREF="sql-altertable.html"
>ALTER TABLE</A
> command.
  </P
><P
>   The table owners and superusers bypass the row security system when
   querying a table, by default.  Row security can be enabled for
   superusers and table owners by setting
   <A
HREF="runtime-config-client.html#GUC-ROW-SECURITY"
>row_security</A
> to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>force</TT
>.  Any
   user can request that row security be bypassed by setting
   <A
HREF="runtime-config-client.html#GUC-ROW-SECURITY"
>row_security</A
> to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>off</TT
>.  If
   the user does not have privileges to bypass row security when
   querying a given table then an error will be returned instead.  Other
   users can be granted the ability to bypass the row security system
   with the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>BYPASSRLS</TT
> role attribute.  This
   attribute can only be set by a superuser.
  </P
><P
>   Each policy has a name and multiple policies can be defined for a
   table.  As policies are table-specific, each policy for a table must
   have a unique name.  Different tables may have policies with the
   same name.
  </P
><P
>   When multiple policies apply to a given query, they are combined using
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OR</TT
>, similar to how a given role has the privileges
   of all roles which they are a member of.
  </P
><P
>   Referential integrity checks, such as unique or primary key constraints
   and foreign key references, will bypass row security to ensure that
   data integrity is maintained.  Care must be taken when developing
   schemas and row level policies to avoid a "covert channel" leak of
   information through these referential integrity checks.
  </P
><P
>   To enable row security for a table,
   the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER TABLE</TT
> is used.  For example, to enable
   row level security for the table accounts, use:
  </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>-- Create the table first
CREATE TABLE accounts (manager text, company text, contact_email text);
ALTER TABLE accounts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;</PRE
><P
>   To create a policy on the account relation to allow the managers role
   to view the rows of their accounts, the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE POLICY</TT
>
   command can be used:
  </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE POLICY account_managers ON accounts TO managers
    USING (manager = current_user);</PRE
><P
>   If no role is specified, or the special <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"user"</SPAN
> name
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PUBLIC</TT
> is used, then the policy applies to all
   users on the system.  To allow all users to view their own row in
   a user table, a simple policy can be used:
  </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE POLICY user_policy ON users
    USING (user = current_user);</PRE
><P
>   To use a different policy for rows which are being added to the
   table from those rows which are visible, the WITH CHECK clause
   can be used.  This would allow all users to view all rows in the
   users table, but only modify their own:
  </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE POLICY user_policy ON users
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (user = current_user);</PRE
><P
>   Row security can be disabled with the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER TABLE</TT
>
   also.  Note that disabling row security does not remove the
   policies which are defined on the table, they are simply ignored
   and all rows are visible and able to be added, subject to the
   normal privileges system.
  </P
><P
>   Below is a larger example of how this feature can be used in
   production environments, based on a unix password file.
