><P
>    Before we proceed, you should understand the basic
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> system architecture.
    Understanding how the parts of
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> interact will make this
    chapter somewhat clearer.
   </P
><P
>    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres-XL</SPAN
>, in short, is a collection
    of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> database clusters which act as if the whole
    collection is a single database cluster.  Based on your database design,
    each table is replicated or distributed among member databases.
   </P
><P
>    To provide this capability, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres-XL</SPAN
> is
    composed of three major components called the GTM, Coordinator and
    Datanode.  The GTM is responsible to provide ACID property of
    transactions. The Datanode stores table data and handle SQL statements
    locally.  The Coordinator handles each SQL statements from
    applications, determines which Datanode to go, and sends plans on
    to the appropriate Datanodes.
   </P
><P
>    You usually should run GTM on a separate server because GTM has to take
    care of transaction requirements from all the Coordinators and
    Datanodes.  To group multiple requests and responses from
    Coordinator and Datanode processes running on the same server, you can
    configure GTM-Proxy.  GTM-Proxy reduces the number of interactions
    and the amount of data to GTM.  GTM-Proxy also helps handle
    GTM failures.
   </P
><P
>    It is often good practice to run both Coordinator and Datanode on the
    same server because we don't have to worry about workload balance
    between the two, and you can often get at data from replicated tables locally
    without sending an additional request out on the network.
    You can have any number of servers where these
    two components are running.  Because both Coordinator and Datanode
    are essentially PostgreSQL instances, you should configure them to
    avoid resource conflict.  It is very important to assign them
    different working directories and port numbers.
   </P
><P
>    Postgres-XL allows multiple Coordinators to accept statements
    from applications independently but in an integrated way.  Any
    writes from any Coordinator is available from any other
    Coordinators.  They acts as if they are single database.
    The Coordinator's role is to accept statements, find what Datanodes are
    involved, send query plans on to the appropriate Datanodes if
    needed, collect the results
    and write them back to applications.
   </P
><P
>    The Coordinator does not store any user data.  It stores only catalog
    data to determine how to process statements, where the target
    Datanodes are, among others.  Therefore, you don't have to worry
    about Coordinator failure much.  When the Coordinator fails, you
    can just switch to the other one.
   </P
><P
>    The GTM could be single point of failure (SPOF).  To prevent this, you can
    run another GTM as a GTM-Standby to backup GTM's status.  When GTM fails,
    GTM-Proxy can switch to the standby on the fly.  This will be described in
    detail in high-availability sections.
   </P
><P
>    As described above, the Coordinators and Datanodes
    of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres-XL</SPAN
> are
    essentially <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> database servers. In database
    jargon, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> uses a client/server
    model.  A <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> session consists
    of the following cooperating processes (programs):

    <P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
>       A server process, which manages the database files, accepts
       connections to the database from client applications, and
       performs database actions on behalf of the clients.  The
       database server program is called
       <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgres</TT
>.
       
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       The user's client (frontend) application that wants to perform
       database operations.  Client applications can be very diverse
       in nature:  a client could be a text-oriented tool, a graphical
       application, a web server that accesses the database to
       display web pages, or a specialized database maintenance tool.
       Some client applications are supplied with the
       <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> distribution; most are
       developed by users.
      </P
></LI
></UL
><P>
   </P
><P
>    As is typical of client/server applications, the client and the
    server can be on different hosts.  In that case they communicate
    over a TCP/IP network connection.  You should keep this in mind,
    because the files that can be accessed on a client machine might
    not be accessible (or might only be accessible using a different
    file name) on the database server machine.
   </P
><P
>    The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> server can handle
    multiple concurrent connections from clients.  To achieve this it
    starts (<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"forks"</SPAN
>) a new process for each connection.
    From that point on, the client and the new server process
    communicate without intervention by the original
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgres</TT
> process.  Thus, the
    master server process is always running, waiting for
    client connections, whereas client and associated server processes
    come and go.  (All of this is of course invisible to the user.  We
    only mention it here for completeness.)
