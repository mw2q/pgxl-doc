>   Its important to ensure that any global transactions in the cluster
   must either be committed on all the nodes or none of the nodes. If
   global recovery is done in a way such that on one node the
   <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> recovery stops after a commit record of some
   global transaction is processed, but stops before the commit record for
   the same transaction is processed on some other node, the cluster may
   be left in an inconsistent state. Since the commit messages of global
   transactions can arrive out-of-order on different nodes, its very hard
   to find a common synchronization point. For example, for two global
   transactions T1 and T2, the commit messages for these transactions
   can arrive on nodes N1 and N2 such that N1 receives commit message
   for T1 first and N2 receives commit message T2 first. In this case,
   during <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>PITR</ACRONYM
>, irrespective of whether we stop at
   T1 or T2, the cluster would lose its consistency since at least one
   transaction will be marked as committed on one node and as aborted
   on the other node.
  </P
><P
>   During recovery, it can be hard and even impossible to find
   cluster-wide consistent synchronization points. In fact, such
   synchronization points may not exists at all. Postgres-XL provides
   a mechanism to create such synchronization points, called barriers,
   during normal operation. A barrier can be created by using a SQL
   command <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>BARRIER</TT
>
  </P
><P
>   The user must connect to one of the Coordinators and issue the
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>BARRIER</TT
> command, optionally followed by an
   identifier. If the user does not specify an identifier, an unique
   identifier will be generated and returned to the caller.  Upon
   receiving the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>BARRIER</TT
> command, the Coordinator
   temporarily pauses any new two-phase commits. It also communicates with
   other Coordinators to ensure that there are no in-progress two-phase
   commits in the cluster. At that point, a barrier <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
>
   record along with the user-given or system-generated BARRIER identifier
   is writtent to the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> stream of all Datanodes and
   the Coordinators.
  </P
><P
>   The user can create as many barriers as she wants to. At the time of
   point-in-time-recovery, the same barrier id must be specified in the
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>recovery.conf</TT
> files of all the Coordinators and
   Datanodes. When every node in the cluster recovers to the same barrier
   id, a cluster-wide consistent state is reached. Its important that
   the recovery must be started from a backup taken before the barrier
   was generated. If no matching barrier record is found, either because
   the barrier was created before the base backup used for the recovery
   or the said barrier was never created, the recovery is run to the end.
  </P
><P
>   Note that in the current release, Postgres-XL has no means to detect
   if another barrier with the same name already exists. So the user
   must be careful while choosing a barrier identifier and ensure
   that an unique identifier is used for every barrier. Similarly, at
   the time of recovery, the user must specify the same barrier id in the
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>recovery.conf</TT
> file on all the nodes. Otherwise,
   the cluster would not recover to a global consistent image.
