><P
>     Postgres-XL is an open source project to provide both write-scalability
     and massively parallel processing transparently to PostgreSQL.  It is a
     collection of tightly coupled database components which can be installed
     on more than one system or virtual machine.
    </P
><P
>     Write-scalable means Postgres-XL can be configured with as many database
     servers as you want and handle many more writes (updating SQL statements)
     than a single standalone database server could otherwise do. You can have
     more than one database server that provides a single database view.  Any
     database update from any database server is immediately visible to any
     other transactions running on different servers.  Transparent means you do
     not necessarily need to worry about how your data is stored in more than
     one database servers internally.

    </P
><P
>    You can configure Postgres-XL to run on more than one machine. It stores
    your data in a distributed way, that is, partitioned or replicated
    depending on what is chosen for each table.
    <A
NAME="AEN127"
HREF="#FTN.AEN127"
><SPAN
CLASS="footnote"
>[2]</SPAN
></A
>
    When you issue queries, Postgres-XL determines where the target data is
    stored and dispatches corresponding plans to the servers containing the
    target data.
   </P
><P
>    In typical web systems, you can have as many web servers or application
    servers to handle your transactions. However, you cannot do this for a
    database server in general because all the changing data have to be visible
    to all the transactions. Unlike other database cluster solutions,
    Postgres-XL provides this capability. You can install as many database
    servers as you like. Each database server provides uniform data view to
    your applications.  Any database update from any server is immediately
    visible to applications connecting the database from other servers. This is
    one of the most important features of Postgres-XL.
   </P
><P
>    The other significant feature of Postgres-XL is MPP parallelism.  You can
    use Postgres-XL to handle workloads for Business Intelligence, Data
    Warehousing, or Big Data. In Postgres-XL, a plan is generated once on a
    coordinator, and sent down to the individual data nodes. This is then
    executed, with the data nodes communicating directly with one another,
    where each understands from where it is expected to receive any tuples that
    it needs to ship, and where it needs to send to others.

>Postgres-XL's Goal</A
></H2
><P
>    The ultimate goal of Postgres-XL is to provide database scalability with
    ACID consistency across all types of database workloads.  That is,
    Postgres-XL should provide the following features:
    <P
></P
></P><UL
COMPACT="COMPACT"
><LI
><P
>       Postgres-XL should provide multiple servers to accept transactions and
       statements from applications, which are known as "Coordinator"
       processes.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       Any Coordinator should provide a consistent database view to
       applications. Any updates from any Coordinator must be visible in real
       time as if such updates are done in single PostgreSQL server.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       Postgres-XL should allow Datanodes to communicate directly with one
       another execute queries in an efficient and parallel manner.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       Tables should be able to be stored in the database designated as
       replicated or distributed (known as fragments or partitions).
       Replication and distribution should be transparent to applications; that
       is, such replicated and distributed tables are seen as single tables and
       the location or number of copies of each record/tuple is managed by
       Postgres-XL and is not visible to applications.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       Postgres-XL provides compatible PostgreSQL API to applications.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       Postgres-XL should provide single and unified view of
       underlying PostgreSQL database servers so that SQL statements
       do not depend on how the tables are actually stored.

><P
>    In this section, we will describe the main components of Postgres-XL.
   </P
><P
>    Postgres-XL is composed of three major components: the GTM (Global
    Transaction Manager), the Coordinator and the Datanode. Their features are
    given in the following sections.

><P
>     The GTM is a key component of Postgres-XL to provide consistent
     transaction management and tuple visibility control.
    </P
><P
>     As described later in this manual, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>'s
     transaction management is based upon MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency
     Control) technology.  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres-XL</SPAN
> extracts this
     technology into separate component such as the GTM so that any
     <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres-XL</SPAN
> component's transaction management
     is based upon single global status.  Details will be described in <A

>Coordinator</A
></H3
><P
>     The Coordinator is an interface to the database for applications. It acts
     like a conventional PostgreSQL backend process, however the Coordinator
     does not store any actual data. The actual data is stored by the Datanodes
     as described below. The Coordinator receives SQL statements, gets Global
     Transaction Id and Global Snapshots as needed, determines which Datanodes
     are involved and asks them to execute (a part of) statement.  When issuing
     statement to Datanodes, it is associated with GXID and Global Snapshot so
     that Multi-version Concurrency Control (MVCC) properties extend
     cluster-wide.

NAME="AEN162"
>Datanode</A
></H3
><P
>     The Datanode actually stores user data. Tables may be distributed among
     Datanodes, or replicated to all the Datanodes.  The Datanode does not have
     a global view of the whole database, it just takes care of locally stored
     data. Incoming statements are examined by the Coordinator as described
     next, and subplans are made. These are  then transferred to each Datanode
     involved together with a GXID and Global Snapshot as needed. The datanode
     may receive request from various Coordinators in separate sessions.
     However, because each transaction is identified uniquely and associated
     with a consistent (global) snapshot, each Datanode can properly execute in
     its transaction and snapshot context.
