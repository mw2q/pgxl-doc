>Description</H2
><P
>   The <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE POLICY</TT
> command defines a new policy for a
   table.  Note that row level security must also be enabled on the table using
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER TABLE</TT
> in order for created policies to be applied.
  </P
><P
>   A policy grants the ability to SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE rows
   which match the relevant policy expression.  Existing table rows are
   checked against the expression specified via USING, while new rows that
   would be created via INSERT or UPDATE are checked against the expression
   specified via WITH CHECK.  When a USING expression returns true for a given
   row then that row is visible to the user, while if a false or null is
   returned then the row is not visible.  When a WITH CHECK expression
   returns true for a row then that row is added, while if a false or null is
   returned then an error occurs.
  </P
><P
>   Generally, the system will enforce filter conditions imposed using
   security policies prior to qualifications that appear in the query itself,
   in order to the prevent the inadvertent exposure of the protected data to
   user-defined functions which might not be trustworthy.  However,
   functions and operators marked by the system (or the system
   administrator) as LEAKPROOF may be evaluated before policy
   expressions, as they are assumed to be trustworthy.
  </P
><P
>    For INSERT and UPDATE queries, WITH CHECK expressions are enforced after
    BEFORE triggers are fired, and before any data modifications are made.
    Thus a BEFORE ROW trigger may modify the data to be inserted, affecting
    the result of the security policy check.  WITH CHECK expressions are
    enforced before any other constraints.
  </P
><P
>   Policy names are per-table, therefore one policy name can be used for many
   different tables and have a definition for each table which is appropriate to
   that table.
  </P
><P
>   Policies can be applied for specific commands or for specific roles.  The
   default for newly created policies is that they apply for all commands and
   roles, unless otherwise specified.  If multiple policies apply to a given
   query, they will be combined using OR (although <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON CONFLICT DO
   UPDATE</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSERT</TT
> policies are not combined in this way, but
   rather enforced as noted at each stage of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON CONFLICT</TT
> execution).
   Further, for commands which can have both USING and WITH CHECK policies (ALL
   and UPDATE), if no WITH CHECK policy is defined then the USING policy will be
   used for both what rows are visible (normal USING case) and which rows will
   be allowed to be added (WITH CHECK case).
  </P
><P
>   Note that while policies will be applied for explicit queries against tables
   in the system, they are not applied when the system is performing internal
   referential integrity checks or validating constraints.  This means there are
   indirect ways to determine that a given value exists.  An example of this is
   attempting to insert a duplicate value into a column which is the primary key
   or has a unique constraint.  If the insert fails then the user can infer that
   the value already exists (this example assumes that the user is permitted by
   policy to insert records which they are not allowed to see).  Another example
   is where a user is allowed to insert into a table which references another,
   otherwise hidden table.  Existence can be determined by the user inserting
   values into the referencing table, where success would indicate that the
   value exists in the referenced table.  These issues can be addressed by
   carefully crafting policies which prevent users from being able to insert,
   delete, or update records at all which might possibly indicate a value they
   are not otherwise able to see, or by using generated values (e.g.: surrogate
   keys) instead.
  </P
><P
>   Regarding how policy expressions interact with the user: as the expressions
   are added to the user's query directly, they will be run with the rights of
   the user running the overall query.  Therefore, users who are using a given
   policy must be able to access any tables or functions referenced in the
   expression or they will simply receive a permission denied error when
   attempting to query the RLS-enabled table.  This does not change how views
   work, however.  As with normal queries and views, permission checks and
   policies for the tables which are referenced by a view will use the view
   owner's rights and any policies which apply to the view owner.
